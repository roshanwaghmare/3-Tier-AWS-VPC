--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
********************************************************************************************************************

Terraform link : https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads?product_intent=terraform

go to Linux -> Amazon Linux -> 

sudo yum install -y yum-utils shadow-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install terraform

terraform --version 

install AWS CLI 

curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

aws --version

go to aws consule > IAM > craete user > admin access> Security credentials > create Access Key & Secrect Access key id

Now go back to Terminal 

aws configure to configure aws user or account i have provided admin acess 

AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA42KQFIALCZMLA45W
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 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

Terraform Session 16-19
**********************************************************************************************************************
lunch terrafrom EC2 instance 
sudo su -
hostname terraform
sudo su -
create main.tf file
resource "aws_s3_bucket"                        "example" {
  bucket = "my-tf-test-bucket"

  tags = {
    Name        =                                   "My bucket"
    Environment = "Dev"
  }
}
terraform validate even the file is not proprly aligned it will not give an syntex error it will only check the syntex  
terraform fmt  cmd will align the format 
terrafrom plan  will show the plan 

terraform plan -out sample.txt it will save the plan in the sample.txt file next time when you apply you it wont show u plan directly excute and create stuff

terraform apply 
bucket name must be unique
if u run terraform apply again it will it not create anything it will match the your real infrastucture with terraform current state and give an output

terraform.tfstate file is most important aspect of terraform beacuse it contain all the infrature details
this help us to trace back what changes happened privously and keep track of everything

(+) added
(-) destroyed
(~) changed

terraform apply --auto-approve to auto approve without yes or no permission

this kind of environment is useful for stock market like we can run server whenever we require like 9am to 3pm etc.
Terraform backend 
if loacal file is crashed it will then all the file will crash 


*******
LOCAL

The local backend stores state on the local filesystem, locks that state using system APIs, and performs operations locally.  

*******
REMOTE

The remote backend is unique among all other Terraform backends because it can both store state snapshots and execute operations for Terraform Cloud's CLI-driven run workflow. It used to be called an "enhanced" backend.

*******
AWS S3

Stores the state as a given key in a given bucket on Amazon S3. This backend also supports state locking and consistency checking via Dynamo DB, which can be enabled by setting the dynamodb_table field to an existing DynamoDB table name. A single DynamoDB table can be used to lock multiple remote state files. Terraform generates key names that include the values of the bucket and key variables.

and S3 we have Bucket Versioning that will version our state file if u run code 5 time it will crete 5 files it will easy to trace
